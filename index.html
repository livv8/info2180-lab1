		<h2> Olivia Hibbert </h2>
		<p> I am an Information Tecchnology Major, who likes the colour purple. I love to read fiction novels and play games. In my opinion Stormy weather is the best when you are at home or in a comfortable environment. In the future I aspire to pass this course. I am intreseted in Web development because i find that i like it more than any other part of dealing with computers, and i would also love to broaden my knowledge. </p>
